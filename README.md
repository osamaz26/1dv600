Hangman

In this course you are going to implement the game "Hangman" in a text based fashion in the language that you have used in previous courses (Java or JavaScript). The basic idea of Hangman is that the player is going to guess a word by suggesting letter after letter. The player is presented with the number of letters in the word but for every wrong guess, the game is building a part of a man getting hanged. The number of wrongs that the player can have is about eight or ten depending on how many parts are used to hang the man (ground, vertical pole, horizontal pole, head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg and right arm or similar). More information on Hangman itself can be found on Wikipedia by searching for Hangman.

 

For this text based version the player should be greeted with a menu and when beginning the game a word from a predefined list of nouns should randomly be picked and the number of letters displayed with equally many underscore signs. Build the "image" of the hanging man using the available characters on the keyboard or by using Unicode characters.

 

In addition to the requirements described here, it is recommended that you find and complement it by add your own ideas like a high score list, user registration, persistence, multiplayer, time limit, point systems, the ability to add and remove words and much more. You decide and outline it in your project documentation.
